Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Hassan, Iâ€™m a passionate and versatile Automation Engineer with a strong foundation in backend development, API design, and test automation. Over the years, I've had the privilege of wearing many hats working with small to medium-sized businesses â€” from backend development and API integration to test automation and product management. My career has allowed me to build a well-rounded skill set, but my focus now lies in backend development and creating efficient test automation frameworks.

This portfolio highlights my expertise in backend development, API design, and automated tests to ensure software excellence. Iâ€™m dedicated to writing clean, maintainable code and building scalable APIs that empower applications. Whether itâ€™s working with JavaScript or TypeScript, or integrating complex backend systems, I aim to create solutions that drive quality and reliability.

- **Individual Contributor: Software Developer in Test (SDET)**
I focus on building robust automated test frameworks that ensure software quality at scale. I have worked with many companies to build their automation frameworks in Selenium, Playwright, and Appium from the ground up to be maintainable and scalable, I design and implement both unit and end-to-end tests, enabling teams to ship features quickly without sacrificing quality. My work revolves around continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) to ensure smooth deployment cycles.

- **Quality Assurance**
If it ain't broke don't fix it? I say: if it ain't broke, let me test it first. There are no assumptions in quality and I specialize in crafting comprehensive testing strategies that incorporate both manual and automated approaches to ensure teams are confident when shipping a product to production. From functional to non-functional requirements, I guarantee that every feature is thoroughly tested for performance, security, and usability. I believe in proactive testing and always aim to catch issues early in the development cycle.

- **Back-End Developer**
I have a strong foundation in backend development, building scalable and efficient APIs with technologies like Node.js, Javascriptui, and TypeScript. Iâ€™m experienced in designing RESTful services, optimizing database interactions, and ensuring that applications perform seamlessly under heavy load. I focus on writing clean, maintainable code that can evolve with the product.

- **Product Management**
With my broad skill set, Iâ€™ve also contributed to product management by collaborating with cross-functional teams to align on product goals, user requirements, and timelines. I enjoy defining the product vision and working to ensure that features meet user needs and quality standards. My approach to product management is hands-on, leveraging technical insights to bridge the gap between development and business
